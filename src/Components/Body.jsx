          "Hey! IÂ´m Marcos. My taste for computing and programming led me to learn new technologies and new languages 
          by myself. I am proactive and capable of adapting to any circumstance and always giving my best 
          in projects. At the same time I strive to work as a team and promote values such as companionship and teamwork.
          Besides programming, I am passionate about music and music production. I am looking to establish myself in a 
          company that I can help with my skills and to continue growing in this world. It is not an obstacle to be able 
          to move to another country or city, I am open to new opportunities where they arise."</i></p>
